# Why should you apply for YC and how do you make sure you get in?

You’ve got a great idea and feel you can make a great company and product out of it. You’ve worked on a basic version and feel like you’re ready to enter the big leagues. Maybe the accelerator program of YCombinator is a good idea? But you’ve got so many questions. 
When are you ready for the next step? How can YC help you? What are some tips or tricks to get in and what should you highlight in the application process?

We figured that everything can be boiled down to 2 or 3 main questions. Why should you apply for YC? If you apply, how do you get in? And of course; what’s it like when you do get in?

#### Why should you apply?
The reason we applied for YC with GitLab was that we had lost our first customer mid 2014. The customer explained that the reason was that while they liked GitLab they were standardizing on an alternative solution. Dmitriy and Sid figured every company would standardize on one solution and they wanted that company to be GitLab. The need to grow faster became the main reason to apply since there was a small window of opportunity where people would standardize on one tool and that after that people would be decided. 

We feel that the time to apply for YCombinator is when you have mainly outlined your product vision, you’re still working somewhat on the market, and are still trying to figure out how to sell it and how to scale to accommodate your customers. The YCombinator program is ideal when you have a solid team of founders that have been working together for a while but are ready to hire the rest of the team after you complete the YCombinator program. So why chose YCombinator if there are more than 2000 accelerator programs in the world? We feel that YCombinator has the best network, the best partners, the best advice to give you because they see the most companies and are very strong at selecting them.
Going where the other strong applicants are, you will have a program where they have the largest set of data to offer you advice. Investors have noticed the YCombinator pattern which helps you raise funding under better terms with better investors. Our YCombinator experience exceeded our high expectations. 

Just last week Craig Cannon posted an article on [the most common misconceptions about applying for YCombinator](http://themacro.com/articles/2016/09/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/). A concern people have sometimes is being a single founder, which is addressed in this article. While YCombinator does [suggest having a cofounder](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/18/paul-graham-dropbox-and-the-single-founder-exception/#1f0fadfb1f77) because startups are hard and cofounders definitely help, of the Summer 2016 batch, 8.5% had a solo founder. Here’s how the rest breaks down: 2 Founders (61.3%), 3 Founders (20.8%), 4 Founders (7.5%), 5+ Founders (1.9%). It may feel like being a single founder would make it harder to get the same load of work done, where it’s not so much that YCombinator will be hard on your own, running a company on your own will be too.

#### If you decide to apply, how do you get in?
Take your time working on your answers for the application. Apply ahead of the deadline and don’t wait until the last minute if you can. But even last minute and late applications get a fair review so feel free to sleep on it.

Describe what your company does and why it’s unique. Be concise and opt for simple descriptions with the use mundane language, because a reason why you could get declined is that someone doesn’t understand.

Have other people review your application. Ask them “what does my company do”? and write down their answer. Take that answer they have given you and add it to your application. Writing down what your company does is one of the hardest things, so if you don’t agree with their answer than your first answer wasn’t clear enough.
 
Everyone feels their product is is better, faster, easier, so get down to specifics why you feel that way but keep it simple. If people can’t recite back to you what it is you do and why you’re different, you have to change your answers.

There is a question in the application: “Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered” don’t gloss over that one, it’s important. Choose an answer or situation that shows you’re an independent thinker and are creative. 

When you get invited to do a 10 minute interview after you’ve sent in your application make sure to prepare for the interview in detail. They will ask you questions which are to be found on the internet so make sure to write down your answers and practice those. Your answers need to be concise and clear, when they are too long you will get cut off.

So spill the beans; what’s it like?
YCombinator raises your ambition level; everyone is motivated by the feeling of progress, and that’s what fast growth gives you. You’re in a batch with the best people in the world, it’s a form of healthy peer pressure that motivates you to work harder and set that high pace to keep developing your product.

The first thing they ask you to do is launch, in case you haven’t done that yet. YCombinator teaches you not to want your feature or product to be a certain way before shipping. Ship today, and make it better or nicer over time. As soon as it’s live you’ll have more information and data on what the real problems are. 

Figuring out who your ideal customers are, how to reach them, how to raise your financing, how to hire people, these are questions that everyone in the program has. The team of YCombinator is really good at helping you to answer these questions and getting to the next level.
