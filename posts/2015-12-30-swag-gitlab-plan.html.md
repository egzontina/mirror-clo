Some GitLab users who should be celebrating the festive season might be suffering from post-Christmas blues. Maybe you didn‚Äôt get everything you wanted for Christmas. We feel partly responsible for that, and we want to make it up to you. 

We‚Äôre so happy when people contact us to ask for some swag: a sticker, a t-shirt, anything! Then we feel sad because we don‚Äôt have a swag shop and we have no way to get people something to show their appreciation. This is a great problem to have: too much love. 

So now we‚Äôre hard at work to get a swag shop set up. If you want to be the absolute first to know about it, sign up below. Bonus: You‚Äôll be entered into a prize draw for a gift. Good luck! 

There's another way to win too.

The truth is, swag does matter. Even the humble sticker can communicate so much about identity and interest. On OpenSource.com Rikki Endlsey wrote about [Open source sticker culture](https://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-source-stickers#culture). Rikki details how people share their support for and help promote projects and people by using stickers, including more exclusive ‚Äúearned‚Äù stickers showing achievements or events attended.

My friend Kristof Van Tomme, who works within several networks, can demonstrate his affiliations and connections quickly. Something as simple as a sticker can spark the next important conversation he has.

I‚Äôm really curious about the great swag you‚Äôve seen. Please share a pic of your laptop as a self portrait on twitter. As another incentive, we‚Äôre going to run this until our swag store opens and then we‚Äôll do a draw from all the #swagportrait hashtag entries on anyone who shares on the hashtag. Will you play along? Here‚Äôs mine! (Well OK this is my old computer, my new one needs stickers.)

## Let‚Äôs talk swag

I think it‚Äôs pretty clear we need to have some nice stickers, with designs for events and as rewards. But we want to develop some other ideas. What we want to avoid is ‚Äúbad swag‚Äù. Bad swag might be poor quality and wasteful swag. 

We can promise that we will never make a comedy unibrow mug.

Realex Payments‚Äô [‚ÄúBad Swag‚Äù campaign](https://www.realexpayments.com/bad-swag) made a point in saying that some companies consider ‚Äúdeveloper relations‚Äù to be about making swag, forgetting that swag is just a symbol of a relationship with developers, not the relationship itself. 

At GitLab, we don‚Äôt want to focus only on building tools for developers that we forget to support the community and help them connect.  So let‚Äôs talk about **good swag**. What is some good swag you've seen? 

Among [other great swag ideas](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33361/Event-Swag-Your-Attendees-Will-Love-and-Loathe.aspx), Hubspot lists ‚ÄúUnique Food Items‚Äù as great swag. We did stroopwafels for OSCON in Amsterdam. Everyone loves a good stroopwafel!

We‚Äôre also thinking of ways to use alternative materials, create locally, and support makers. I love the [Resketch notebooks](http://resketchbook.com/) by Shawn Smith which use reclaimed materials to make fun notebooks. I like that this kind of product reduces waste. Have you seen other cool products like that?

A while back, I asked a talented craftsperson I know, [A Million Paper Stars](https://www.facebook.com/amillionpaperstars), to make a bag for me to carry my various computer charger, mouse, etc. I wanted to get creative and try something different. Would you be interested in handmade swag?
