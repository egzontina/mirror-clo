Once considered a radical upstart, open source has moved from disruption to default. Its methods and culture
commoditized the technologies that drove the Internet revolution and transformed the practice of software
development.

Since 1999, O’Reilly Media has organized OSCON, an annual convention for the discussion of free and open source
software.

OSCON is where all of the pieces come together: developers, innovators, business people, and investors. At OSCON,
you'll find everything open source: languages, communities, best practices, products and services. Rather than focus
on a single language or aspect, such as cloud computing, OSCON allows you to learn about and practice the entire
range of open source technologies.

GitLab will be sponsoring OSCON in Amsterdam from October 26th to October 28th, 2015. Would you like to join us? 

<!-- more -->

We have one special pass to give to one of our users. This pass is worth 1,545 Euros and
it will give you access to all sessions, keynotes and tutorials, 2 months of Safari Pro, access to all on-site
networking events and lunch from Monday to Wednesday.
