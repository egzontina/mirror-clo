Starting today, I'm joining the GitLab team as a software developer where I'll be working on GitLab CE and EE.
I started the GitLab project together with Dmitriy 3 years ago. Today, we are together again :)
I like Ruby, UNIX, git and other cool technologies. 
I have a very strong desire to improve the world by making all things easier.
