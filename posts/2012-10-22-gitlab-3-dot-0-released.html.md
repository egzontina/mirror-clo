### GitLab version 3.0 released

Good news everyone!

Today is 22th and it means we have a GitLab release today. It is our 13th release. Yippee!

Every month we give you a new version of GitLab and we will try to save this tradition. 
Also we will keep GitLab free and open source product in future.

__Special thanks to GitLab core team who contribute so much awesome code in GitLab.__

Also thanks to GitLab co-author & core developer Valeriy Sizov. 
He helps me move forward even despite of all difficulties on our way.

### Few quotes from core devs:

_Valeriy Sizov:_

> GitLab is developing by developers from different parts of the world. 
You can trust us - we fix critical issues in 24 hours

_Dmitriy Zaporozhets:_
> I had a dream about high-quality FOSS product I can admire - my dream come true.

_Valeriy Sizov:_
> Our will is solid as rock. GitLab 3 is very cool but version 4 will be even better. 
GitLab is not an only software we are going to share with this world. 
We are developers and if miss something - we build it!

_Dmitriy Zaporozhets:_

> We are going to build a best software. GitLab 3 is not an end - it is only a begining
