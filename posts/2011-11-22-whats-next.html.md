'Pronto' released. We are on our way to version 2. The main goal is <strong>gitolite</strong> support. I think of some other features I find useful for project:
<ul>
	<li>Project wiki</li>
	<li>Workflow/Branch management (create/remove branch, tag etc)</li>
	<li>Commit/Branch diff</li>
	<li>Merge requests</li>
	<li>Issues tags</li>
	<li>File tab listing all files attached to notes</li>
	<li>Advanced user profile</li>
</ul>
Also some things should be improved:
<ul>
	<li>New design is far from perfect. It should be polished</li>
	<li>I dont like tree browse perfomance</li>
        <li>Activities page requires pagination like 'commits' or 'wall' page</li>
        <li>Usability</li>
</ul>

Some We'll try to implement for 2.0, other will be announced as part of 2.1.
Anyway I'll continue my work on this project & hope you'll like it.
