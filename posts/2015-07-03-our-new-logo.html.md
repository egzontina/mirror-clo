<!-- more -->

We've [asked](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/18/a-new-gitlab-logo/) for your
opinion and have finally chosen this to be our new logo:

![GitLab Tanuki](/images/press/logo/wm.svg)

And without background:

![GitLab Logo](/images/press/logo/wm_no_bg.svg)

We used to have an angry looking raccoon dog, now it's an abstract
raccoon dog - or better sounding: a GitLab [Tanuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog).

The logo and type was created by [designer Ty Wilkins](http://www.tywilkins.com/).

We were very excited with all the cool fanart we've received with our last logo,
we hope to receive even more with this one!
You can find the original SVGs [on our press page](https://about.gitlab.com/press/).

The new logo will appear in GitLab 7.13.

As always, we'd love to hear what you think.
