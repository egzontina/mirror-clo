As you may have [heard already](https://twitter.com/gitlabstatus/status/353436853090787328), GitLab Cloud is now running the latest [GitLab 5.3 release](/2013/06/20/gitlab-5-dot-3-released).Â You can now view a contributor graph per project, integrate with HipChat and Campfire, tweak permissions on your snippets, and get a Scrum-style overview of the issues attached to a milestone. We hope you like it!
