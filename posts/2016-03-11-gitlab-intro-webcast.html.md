In our latest webcast, we highlighted a typical daily workflow when using GitLab.
We looked at features in GitLab which emphasize conversation, collaborating
early, improving discoverability, and keeping your momentum going.

[Job](http://twitter.com/jobvo) showed how he starts his day, checking his todo list,
providing feedback on issues, line-by-line code review, and getting to work on his
own commits. 
This demo is based on [GitLab Flow](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html)
which is lightweight and scales easily for even large teams.
