A few days ago two security vulnerabilities in Git were [made
public](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/03/15/5). In
response, we [released GitLab
8.5.7](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/16/gitlab-8-dot-5-dot-7-released/) the
same day.

At the time, there was still some confusion regarding which version of Git
contained all of the security fixes. Yesterday, Git version 2.7.4 was released
with the fixes for all known vulnerabilities.

Due to the potential impact of this vulnerability, we've released new
omnibus-gitlab packages for the past four months' releases
(8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5).

In this blog post we will go into more detail about the vulnerabilities and
their impact on GitLab.

## The problem

An attacker can create a malicious Git repository that causes a [heap
overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_overflow) in `git` commands
that run on that repository (e.g.,
`git clone https://example.com/evil-repo.git`). At best this causes your
`git` command to crash; at worst the malicious Git repository
effectively becomes a program that runs on your computer.

This vulnerability got fixed in Git version 2.7.4.

## General impact

If you are using a vulnerable version of the Git client and you run the "right"
`git` command on a malicious repository, an attacker may gain control over your
computer. It also means that if an attacker can upload a malicious repository to
a GitLab server, and if that GitLab server has a vulnerable version of Git
installed, then the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the GitLab server.

## Impact on GitLab

During various operations GitLab will run `git` commands on the repositories it
hosts. If your GitLab server uses a vulnerable version of Git and if one of your
users pushed or imported a malicious repository onto your server then attacker
code embedded in the malicious Git repository may be executed on the GitLab
server as the application user.

## What we are doing about it

We have released the new omnibus-gitlab packages for versions going back to
GitLab version 8.2.

The Omnibus packages for GitLab 8.2.4, 8.3.5, 8.4.6 and 8.5.8 contain Git
version 2.7.4.

We understand it's not always possible for all of our users to upgrade to the
latest monthly releases. However, we urge you to upgrade to the latest
available version as it contains the latest security fixes for all bundled
software.

## What you should do about it

You should make sure that you are using the latest version of Git on
each computer you use Git. Because there are many different ways to
install Git it is difficult to give specific instructions how to this.

If you are an administrator for a GitLab server and you installed GitLab
using our Omnibus packages then you should make sure you are [using
GitLab 8.5.8 or newer](https://about.gitlab.com/update/).

If you installed GitLab from source or through some other means it is
not enough to update to the latest version of GitLab; you should make
sure you are using the latest version of Git for your platform.

If you installed Git from source according to the GitLab installation
guide you can check its version by running:

    /usr/local/bin/git --version

You should also verify that GitLab is seeing the correct version of Git by
visiting your Administration dashboard and looking under **Components**.
