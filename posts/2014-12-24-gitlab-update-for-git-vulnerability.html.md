Today we have released updated versions of our Omnibus packages for the existing GitLab 7.6.1 Community Edition and GitLab 7.6.2
Enterprise Edition. These updated packages contain an updated Git binary (2.0.5) that resolves the recent [Git vulnerability]
(https://about.gitlab.com/2014/12/19/gitlab-not-affected-by-CVE-2014-9390-git-vulnerability/).

This server side fix blocks incoming Git repositories that contain a malicious tree, so no exploits can be triggered
using these updated GitLab versions. GitLab.com has already been updated.

If you recently updated your Omnibus GitLab installation to 7.6.1 CE or 7.6.2 EE, these packages will only update the
Git binary. It is a painless upgrade.

If you are running GitLab on a manual installation, you can manually update the Git client on the server and run the
following command: `sudo git config --system receive.fsckObjects true`

We encourage our users to update their GitLab installations, specially if they allow sign-ups and have public projects.
