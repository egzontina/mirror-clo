We held our first webcast last week, and we’re so delighted you came along. We looked at new features and improvements included in [GitLab 8.4](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/22/gitlab-8-4-released).
It was excellent to see so many questions from the audience.
It gave us ideas for future webcasts too, so keep the feedback coming!

We had more than we could even fit into the room, so we apologize to anyone who was unable to get in. We’ve increased our capacity so that doesn’t happen again.
