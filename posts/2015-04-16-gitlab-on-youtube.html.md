Did you know GitLab has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg)?

We've just put up some videos that we made earlier for the [webinar](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/03/gitlab-wandisco-webinar/) together
with WANdisco.

In the videos, we cover LDAP management, workflows, permissions and
**GitLab Annex**. Definitely worth a watch.

You can find the videos in a playlist below, enjoy!
