### GitLab 5.4 released

Hi everyone!

Today we release GitLab v5.4. There are not many new features because we are getting close to GitLab v6.0 (to be released on August 22). Nevertheless we hope you will enjoy the tracking of participants in Issues, email notifications for mentions and the ability to edit comments!

### The 3 most important improvements in GitLab 5.4

1. Edit Comments
2. Show Issue Participants
