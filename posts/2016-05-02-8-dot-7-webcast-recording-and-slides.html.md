GitLab 8.7 improves Issues, makes diffs easier to work with, brings better
commenting, allows you to push to remote repositories, and more.
In our latest webcast, we looked at the highlights from this release. 


Our Backend Lead, Douwe Maan, gave us a live demo of the latest features
in [GitLab 8.7](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/22/gitlab-8-7-released/).
He walked us through a common user scenario to demostrate how these new
features will benefit our users. 

<!-- more -->

Some of those benefits include: 

* Improved web Git workflow 
* Increased discoverability 
* Improved project management 
* Improved collaboration experience
