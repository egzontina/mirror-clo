[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com) is proud to participate in the [Apple TV App Challenge](https://www.applovin.com/appchallenge)!
Apps are the future of TV, and AppLovin aims to cultivate the nascent tvOS dev community.

Got an idea for a tvOS app? Kick-start it by entering the Apple TV App Challenge,
hosted by AppLovin and proudly sponsored by GitLab.
There are two ways to participate:
Either submit a full-featured app to the tvOS App Contest by March 31 or 
attend a 24-hour Hackathon April 16-17.

The best entries will be rewarded with awesome prizes, including $25,000 
to the tvOS App Challenge winner and $5,000 to two Hackathon finalists.
On April 17, Challenge finalists will demo their apps for journalists, VCs, 
and a special guest from Gitlab during an App Challenge showcase.

We're excited to sponsor and support events in software development communities
and help grow awareness of GitLab.
