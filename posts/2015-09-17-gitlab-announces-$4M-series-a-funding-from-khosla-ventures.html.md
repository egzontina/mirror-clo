Today we are proud to announce our $4 million Series A funding from Khosla Ventures.
This follows our [seed round in July](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/07/09/1.5M-raised-in-seed-funding-for-gitlab-to-accelerate-growth-and-expand-operations/).

GitLab will leverage the new funding to accelerate growth and scale its global
operations including development, marketing, and sales. Additionally, GitLab
announced the upcoming release of GitLab 8.0, which is scheduled for release on
September 22.  GitLab 8.0 will include 50 percent less disk usage, faster
merging, Continuous Integration (CI) built into GitLab itself, improved
interface and navigation, and "Reply by email" functionality that allows users
to quickly comment on an issue or merge request from their mobile devices.

More than 100,000 companies and organizations currently use GitLab on-premises
including NASA, CERN, Alibaba, SpaceX, O’Reilly, IBM, and Expedia. These
organizations and many individual contributors hack on, contribute to, and help
GitLab become better every single day.

It is our goal to become the default solution for anyone building software and
working together. The excitement and passion of our community has convinced us
that open-source is the way forward. We want to accelerate our growth and expand
operations so we can reach more people and build an even better GitLab.

## GitLab, an Open-Source Company

Our three product offerings — a free, open source Community Edition, a free SaaS
GitLab.com version, and our Enterprise version – provide accessibility, full
transparency, and stand as a serious challenger to other Git platforms. GitLab
features include:

  - Zero-touch installation and upgrades
  - GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Code, Gitorious importers
  - Two-factor authentication
  - SAML and Kerberos authentication
  - Merge request approvers
  - Audit logging

With this new round of funding, we hope to provide more features, support, and expand to more companies and
organizations as the most popular and most trusted open source code collaboration platform.

After our Y Combinator experience and successful seed round funding, we knew we wanted to go above and beyond what we
had done so far and make GitLab bigger and better for everyone, which is why we are working
with some amazing investors.

Vinod Khosla, founder and partner of Khosla Ventures said this about us:

> “Investing in GitLab was an obvious choice. Open source solutions are the future,
and GitLab is leading the way as the most popular open source code collaboration platform
on the market.”

> “GitLab’s reach in over 100K organizations validates that there is a very large market
demand for a more open solution that enables engineers to create, review, collaborate, and
accelerate the iterative process by deploying code that brings products to market faster.”

We're all very excited with this opportunity our investors have given us.
It means we can accelerate growth and scale our US operations, which
includes the recent opening of a new office in San Francisco (don't worry,
we're [still remote](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)!).

Sytse "Sid" Sijbrandij, our CEO said:

> “GitLab differentiates itself from other collaborative Git platforms because
> we are open source - [and always have been](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/10/08/letter-from-shareholders/).
> Open source helps users to reach their goals faster with the transparency and
> control they expect from their tools.”

> “Our users choose GitLab because they can run it on their own servers, the
> source code is open and adaptable, and organizations can build on top of
> GitLab. We also have a loyal, vocal community of more than 800 contributors
> whose constant improvements help us roll out new features faster than anyone
> else on the market.”

## Thank you for believing in us

We'd like to thank our amazing community that has contributed major features,
bug fixes, documentation updates and more than we can ever return. We owe
GitLab's existence to your enthusiasm, drive, and hard work. Without our contributors'
belief in open source software, GitLab would be nowhere near where it is today.

Thank you to our team that has been working hard every single day and feels more
like a highly distributed, international family than a company.  We especially
thank the [core team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team) members that are not paid
by GitLab Inc: Robert Schilling, Hannes Rosenögger, Achilleas Pipinellis, Stan
Hu, James Newton and Jeroen van Baarsen.
