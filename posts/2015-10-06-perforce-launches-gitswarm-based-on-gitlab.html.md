Today Perforce launched [Helix GitSwarm](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/new-perforce-tool-gives-developers-what-they-love-and-it-what-it-needs/) built on top of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com). GitSwarm combines Perforce and GitLab to enable easy project and team management while allowing developers to collaboratively code using their preferred version control system, Git. 

Weâ€™re happy that Perforce chose GitLab to help their customers create, code, and deploy together. To learn more, have a look at the [GitSwarm overview](http://www.perforce.com/gitswarm).
