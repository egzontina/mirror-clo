## Swag Portrait Contest Winners

We ran a contest over the holiday time to get a peek at how people
were using their stickers on laptops.
Thanks so much for sharing photos!

After looking at the entries, we decided that *everyone* should win a
prize for participating, so all participants will be getting GitLab stickers!

It's cool to see how many different communities and projects people
are fans of! Thanks so much!
