In this post I'll show you how to set up GitLab CI for your iOS projects, 
step-by-step, from start to finish.

### Why CI?

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) 
(CI) is great tool for helping developers be more productive and write higher-
quality code. By automatically running a suite of tests every time a commit is 
pushed, everyone can see the results of changes to the codebase, and take action 
to make integration faster and easier.

GitLab [comes with CI built-in](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) for all 
projects, for free.

It's beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into details on best practices, 
workflows, and advantages/disadvantages of CI. In short, however, here's what 
happens when you enable it for your Xcode project:

1. You make changes to your copy of the codebase and push a commit to GitLab.
2. GitLab recognizes that the codebase has changed.
3. GitLab triggers a build with the GitLab Runner you set up on your Mac for the project.
4. The GitLab Runner runs through the build and test process you specified in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
5. The GitLab Runner reports its results back to GitLab.
6. GitLab shows you the results of the build.

This post builds on [Jeremy White's blog post](http://www.thejeremywhite.com/blog/2015/10/05/xcode-gitlab-ci-setup.html), 
going into a little more detail and correcting some steps for the environment 
described in the next section.

### Assumptions and environment

This post will provide a step-by-step guide to setting up GitLab CI for your iOS
 projects, from start to finish. First, however, we need to make a few assumptions.

[GitLab's strategy document](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/) hinges on one 
key idea: _everyone can contribute_. As such, this post is written for readers 
of nearly all levels of experience. However, given that CI is a relatively 
advanced topic, we're going to assume some basic knowledge of how to create 
Xcode and GitLab projects, as well as some familiarity with Terminal and git.

This post was written with the following development environment in mind:

- A Mac running OS X 10.11.3 "El Capitan"
- Xcode 7.2.1 with command-line tools and the iOS 9.2 SDK installed
- GitLab.com v8.5

We'll also assume you've already created a new GitLab project. If you haven't, 
go ahead and do that now.

### Setting up your Xcode project

We'll start by creating a new single-view iOS project in Xcode.

![Creating a new Xcode project.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/1_create-new-xcode-project.png)

Give your project a name and make certain that the **Include Unit Tests** and 
**Include UI Tests** options are enabled for the project. Xcode will create a 
template test class with some sample tests, which we'll use in this post as the 
test suite that GitLab CI runs to verify a build. Choose a name for your project 
and click on **Next**.

![Enable unit and UI tests in your project](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/2_enable-unit-tests.png)

Choose where you'll save your iOS project. If you like, let Xcode create the git 
repository on your Mac.

![Let Xcode initialize your git repository.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/3_create-git-repository.png)

Once Xcode has created and opened your iOS project, you need to [share its scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-scheme_editor/Articles/SchemeShare.html). Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-scheme_editor/Articles/SchemeDialog.html) defines schemes nicely:

> A scheme is a collection of settings that specify which targets to build, what build configuration to use, and the executable environment to use when the product specified by the target is launched.

By sharing your scheme, GitLab CI gets context it needs to build and test your project.

To share a scheme in Xcode, choose **Product** > **Scheme** > **Manage Schemes**.

![Share your scheme.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/4_share-xcode-scheme.png)

Click on the **Close** button.

Your Xcode project has been created with two test files; one includes sample unit 
tests, and the other includes sample UI tests. You can run **Product** > **Test** 
to run these tests, which will build your project, launch the Simulator, install 
the project on the Simulator device, and run the test suite. You can see the 
results right in Xcode:

![Test suite success in Xcode.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/5_test-suite-success-in-xcode.png)

The green checkmarks next to the test functions (both in the file, and in the 
Test navigator) show that all tests passed. We won't be referring to the Xcode 
project anymore, so if you like, you can close it.

Next, open Terminal and navigate to the folder you created for your iOS project.

It's convenient to add a standard `.gitignore` file. For a Swift project, enter:

```
$ curl -o .gitignore https://www.gitignore.io/api/swift
```

For an Objective-C project, enter:

```
$ curl -o .gitignore https://www.gitignore.io/api/objective-c
```

The `curl` command conveniently downloads the contents of the page at the given [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) URL into a file named `.gitignore`.

If Xcode initialized the git repository for you, you'll need to set the origin 
url to your GitLab project (replaceing `<username>` with your GitLab username 
and `<project>` with the project name:

```
$ git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:<username>/<project>.git
```

The final step here is to [install xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty). 
When Xcode builds and tests your project, xcpretty will transform the output into 
something more readable for you.

### Installing and registering the GitLab Runner

The GitLab Runner is a service that's installed on your Mac, which runs the build 
and test process that you set up in a configuration file. You can follow the 
[installation instructions for OS X](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/master/docs/install/osx.md), 
but we'll need to make some changes to the _register the runner_ step:

```
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner register
WARNING: Running in user-mode.                     
WARNING: The user-mode requires you to manually start builds processing: 
WARNING: $ gitlab-runner run                       
WARNING: Use sudo for system-mode:                 
WARNING: $ sudo gitlab-runner...                   
```

If you're using self-hosted GitLab, the coordinator URL will be http(s)://url-of-your-gitlab-instance/ci`.

```
Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (e.g. https://gitlab.com/ci):
https://gitlab.com/ci
```

The CI token for your project is available on GitLab's Project Settings page, 
under _Advanced Settings_. Each project has a unique token.

```
Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner:
<CI runner token from Project > Settings > Runner>
```

The `register` process suggests the name of your Mac as a description for the 
runner. You can enter something different if you like, or just hit **return** to 
continue.

```
Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner:
[Your-Mac's-Name.local]:
```

Enter whatever tags you'd like to further identify this particular runner. It's 
particularly helpful when you need a particular build environment&mdash;for example, 
iOS 9.2 on Xcode 7.2 on OS X 10.11 could use tags like `ios_9-2`, `xcode_7-2`, 
and `osx_10-11`. This way, we can filter our build stages in GitLab by toolchain, 
platform, etc.

```
Please enter the gitlab-ci tags for this runner (comma separated):
ios_9-2, xcode_7-2, osx_10-11
```

The GitLab Runner will register the runner and give it a unique `runner` ID.

```
Registering runner... succeeded                     runner=s8Bgtktb
```

The GitLab Runner has to run `xcodebuild` to build and test the project, so we 
select `shell` as the executor: 

```
Please enter the executor: virtualbox, ssh, shell, parallels, docker, docker-ssh:
shell
Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running 
already the config should be automatically reloaded! 
```

Continue with the rest of the Runner installation instructions (`install` and 
`start`), per the documentation.

Go to the _Runners_ page in your Project Settings and voil√†:

![The GitLab Runner is recognized in GitLab's Project Settings.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/6_runner-registered.png)

Your GitLab Runner is recognized and (almost) ready to go!

You can verify this by running

```
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner verify
WARNING: Running in user-mode.                     
WARNING: The user-mode requires you to manually start builds processing: 
WARNING: $ gitlab-runner run                       
WARNING: Use sudo for system-mode:                 
WARNING: $ sudo gitlab-runner...                   
                                                   
Veryfing runner... is alive                         runner=25c780b3
```

Note that they have the same ID (in this case, `25c780b3`).

The last thing to do is to configure the build and test settings. To do so, open 
your text editor and enter the following:

```
stages:
  - build

build_project:
  stage: build
  script:
    - xcodebuild clean -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme SchemeName | xcpretty
    - xcodebuild test -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme SchemeName -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6s,OS=9.2' | xcpretty -s
  tags:
    - ios_9-2
    - xcode_7-2
    - osx_10-11
```

Save this file in your Xcode project folder as `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and don't forget 
the period at the beginning of the file name!

> **Update:** To clarify, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file should go in the folder you created for your iOS project, which is also typically where your Xcode project file (`ProjectName.xcodeproj`) is found. Thanks to commenter Palo for pointing this out!

Let's go through the file with some detail:

- The file first describes the `stages` available to each `job`. For simplicity, 
we have one stage (`build`) and one job (`build_project`).
- The file then provides the settings for each `job`. The `build_project` job runs 
two scripts: one to clean the Xcode project, and then another to build and test 
it. You can probably skip the cleaning script to save time, unless you want to be 
sure that you're building from a clean state.
- Under `tags`, add the tags you created when you registered the GitLab Runner.

There are also some things to look out for:

- Make sure to replace all references to `ProjectName` with the name of your 
Xcode project; if you're using a different scheme than the default, then make 
sure you pass in the proper `SchemeName` too (the default is the same as the 
`ProjectName`).
- In the `xcodebuild test` command, notice the `-destination` option is set to 
launch an iPhone 6S image running iOS 9.2 in the Simulator; if you want to run a 
different device (iPad, for example), you'll need to change this.
- If you're using a workspace rather than a project (e.g., because your app uses [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)), change the `-project ProjectName.xcodeproj` 
options to `-workspace WorkspaceName.xcworkspace`. There are several options 
available to customize your build; run `xcodebuild --help` in the Terminal to 
explore these further.

There's a simple tool for "linting" (i.e., validating) your `.gitlab-ci.yml` in 
GitLab. From your GitLab project page, click on _Builds_ in the sidebar, then in 
the upper-right corner, click on **CI Lint**:

![Accessing the GitLab CI script linter.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/7_ci-lint-button.png)

Paste the contents of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into the text box and click on 
**Validate**. You should see something like:

> **Status:** syntax is correct

This won't tell you if your project name or the Simulator chosen is correct, so 
be sure to double-check these settings.

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is extremely customizable. You can limit jobs to run 
on success or failure, or depending on branches or tags, etc.&mdash;read through 
[the documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/README.html) to get a feeling 
for just how flexible and powerful it is.

### Setting up your GitLab project for CI

Actually, there's really not much to do here! CI is enabled by default on new 
projects. If your iOS project has some environment variables you want to keep 
secret, but you want to keep the project public on GitLab, you may want to disable 
**Public builds** in Project Settings, under _Continous Integration_. This will 
hide the build results from everyone except members of the project.

You may also want to go to _Runners_ under your Project Settings and click 
**Disable shared runners**, as they're not needed anyhow&mdash;we're using a 
project-specific runner.

We're now ready to trigger a CI build!

### How to trigger builds

To trigger a build, all you have to do is push a commit to GitLab. From the Terminal:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "First commit."
[...commit info...]
$ git push origin master
[...push info...]
```

If everything worked, and you installed the GitLab Runner on the same machine, 
you'll notice that Simulator launches, installs your iOS app and launches it, and 
then goes back to the home screen.

Go to the *Builds* page of your GitLab project and have a look at the results!

![The Build page after your first CI build.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/8_build-page-success.png)

Click on the <span style=color:green>‚úîÔ∏é success</span> button to see the build output:

![The build results page.](/images/blogimages/setting-up-gitlab-for-ios-projects/9_build-results.png)

Here you'll see the output from all the steps you requested in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` 
file. At the bottom of the log, you should see something like:

```
All tests
Test Suite GitLab-CI-for-iOSTests.xctest started
GitLab_CI_for_iOSTests
    . testExample (0.001 seconds)
    T testPerformanceExample measured (0.000 seconds)
    . testPerformanceExample (0.324 seconds)


	 Executed 2 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.325 (0.328) seconds

All tests
Test Suite GitLab-CI-for-iOSUITests.xctest started
GitLab_CI_for_iOSUITests
    . testExample (3.587 seconds)


	 Executed 1 test, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 3.587 (3.589) seconds


Build succeeded.
```

Now you can go ahead and start writing tests for your code, and every time you 
push a commit, GitLab will diligently fetch the project, clean it, and then build 
and test it. If the build fails, you can take action to fix the commit.

### Starting and stopping the runner on your Mac

The GitLab Runner includes several convenient commands, which you can list easily:

```
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner --help
NAME:
   gitlab-ci-multi-runner - a GitLab Runner

USAGE:
   gitlab-ci-multi-runner [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]
   
VERSION:
   1.0.4 (014aa8c)
   
AUTHOR(S):
   Kamil Trzci≈Ñski <ayufan@ayufan.eu> 
   
COMMANDS:
   archive	find and archive files (internal)
   artifacts	upload build artifacts (internal)
   extract	extract files from an archive (internal)
   exec		execute a build locally
   list		List all configured runners
   run		run multi runner service
   register	register a new runner
   install	install service
   uninstall	uninstall service
   start	start service
   stop		stop service
   restart	restart service
   status	get status of a service
   run-single	start single runner
   unregister	unregister specific runner
   verify	verify all registered runners
   help, h	Shows a list of commands or help for one command
   
GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --debug			debug mode [$DEBUG]
   --log-level, -l "info"	Log level (options: debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic)
   --help, -h			show help
   --version, -v		print the version
```

You may want to stop the Runner so that a build isn't immediately triggered by a 
pushed commit:

```
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner stop
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner status
gitlab-runner: Service is not running.
```
 
In this case, any builds pushed will show up as **pending** and will be triggered 
as soon as you restart the Runner:

```
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner start
$ gitlab-ci-multi-runner status
gitlab-runner: Service is running!
```

Any pending builds in the queue will then be triggered, launching Simulator and 
running the test suite normally.

### Advanced: archiving the project automatically

Let's say that, if we commit to `master`, we want GitLab CI to not only build and 
test the project, but also provide some continuous delivery, where it creates an 
application archive, and uploads it to GitLab.

We start by modifying our `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to add an `archive` stage and an 
`archive_project` job:

```
stages:
  - build
  - archive

build_project:
  stage: build
  script:
    - xcodebuild clean -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme SchemeName | xcpretty
    - xcodebuild test -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme SchemeName -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6s,OS=9.2' | xcpretty -s
  tags:
    - ios_9-2
    - xcode_7-2
    - osx_10-11

archive_project:
  stage: archive
  script:
    - xcodebuild clean archive -archivePath build/ProjectName -scheme SchemeName
    - xcodebuild -exportArchive -exportFormat ipa -archivePath "build/ProjectName.xcarchive" -exportPath "build/ProjectName.ipa" -exportProvisioningProfile "ProvisioningProfileName"
  only:
    - master
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - build/ProjectName.ipa
  tags:
    - ios_9-2
    - xcode_7-2
    - osx_10-11
```

The `archive_project` job runs two scripts: the first cleans and archives your 
Xcode project, and the second builds an `.ipa` file; the `only` setting means that 
this job will only run when we commit to master. Notice that it also defines 
`artifacts`; after the `ProjectName.ipa` application archive is created, this 
option uploads it to GitLab, where you can later download it from the *Build* page.

In the `archive_project` job's `exportArchive` script, make sure you pass in the 
correct `ProvisioningProfileName`. It's possible that the `archive_project` job 
will fail if your developer keys are in the login Keychain, because it's not unlocked
in the script. The simplest way to fix this without putting your password in a
script is to open Keychain Access on your Mac and drag and drop them to the System 
Keychain.

Now, when we commit to master, the build will also show us the archive results, 
along with the option to download or browse our build artifacts!

### Other salient points

- This workflow should work for *any* kind of Xcode project, including tvOS, 
watchOS, and Mac OS X. Just be sure to specify the appropriate Simulator device in 
your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- If you want to push a commit but don't want to trigger a CI build, simply add 
`[ci skip]` to your commit message.
- If the user that installed the GitLab runner isn't logged in, the runner won't 
run. So, if builds seem to be pending for a long time, you may want to check on 
this!
- If you're working on a team, or if your project is public, you may want to install 
the GitLab Runner on a dedicated build machine. It can otherwise be very distracting 
to be using your machine and have Simulator launch unexpectedly to run a test suite.
- The test project used in this particular tutorial is [available here](https://gitlab.com/AngeloStavrow/gitlab-ci-for-ios-projects),
but the Runner is permanently stopped. Note that the project isn't tied to a particular 
team, so provisioning isn't an issue here; in fact, *no* provisioning profile is specified. 
You, however, may need to [add some parameters to the build scripts](https://coderwall.com/p/rv2lgw/use-xcodebuild-to-build-workspace-vs-project) 
in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file if you see provisioning errors in your build output.
