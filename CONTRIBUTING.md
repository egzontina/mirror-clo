### Apply

Submit your application to the program: [Write for GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/writers/).

### Who's working on what?

- When an issue is assigned, that means it's being worked on. You will be assigned an issue to write. 
- If an issue IS assigned, then it means it's being worked on. If it's not assigned, then it's open for proposal

### Write!

Your post will get submitted into the www-gitlab-com using GitLab workflow. 

Here's how it works. 

1. Create a fork of our website project. [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com).
2. Add a post
    - You'll write your blog post in Markdown. 
    - Follow examples under [/source/_posts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/source/_posts)
    - Follow the [style guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md)
3. Create a MR to prompt a review
    - Make the MR in WIP mode. Meaning add WIP to the title so it won't be merged accidentally. 
    - cc @nearlythere to prompt a review
4. Review
    - You will get a formal/style review. Does it follow the style guide? Is it easy to follow?
    - You will get a technical review. A technical review will ensure everything works as expected and follows our best practices.
5. Finally we'll schedule and we'll publish!

(If these steps aren't clear, you can also create a 
first draft in Google Docs, and submit for review.)
