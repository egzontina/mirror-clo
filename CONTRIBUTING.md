## Write for GitLab

Find out more about how you can [Write for GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/writers/).

The posts themselves are published in the [Gitlab.com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com)
There the blog posts are drafted, commented on and merged. 

We aim to improve documentation through this program and add we will add tutorials to
documentation which can live on and continue to be maintained as part of
docs. 

### Step 1 - Get ideas. Review the backlog of issues

* [View High priority issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=High+priority)
* High level [Technical overviews](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=Technical+overview) which explain the "why" behind something and how it all works.
* [Decision maker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=Decision+maker) topics which help people understand benefits and trade-offs.
* Step by step [Tutorials](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=Tutorial)

As well as topics related to the people behind the projects, collaboration, etc. 

* [Open source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=Open+source)
* [Community](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues?label_name=Community)

#### Who's working on what?

- When an issue is assigned, that means it's being worked on. You will be assigned an issue to write. 
- If an issue IS assigned, then it means it's being worked on. 
- If it's not assigned, then it's open for proposal

### Step 2 - Apply

Submit your application to the program: [Write for GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/writers/).

### Step 3 - Propose! 

Before you start writing, we need to work on your proposal.

- Objective: What is the purpose of the article or tutorial?
What value does it offer the reader?
What can they do after reading the article?
- Outline: Write an outline of the main headings from the article

We'll then get a reviewer to give you feedback on the proposal. 

This will also give us a chance to see where we might add to documentation.

### Step 4 - Write!

Your post will get submitted into the www-gitlab-com using GitLab workflow. 

Here's how it works. 

1. Create a fork of our website project. [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com).
    - If your project also includes CE or EE documentation improvements, you can work
    on those in parallel.
2. Add a post
    - You'll write your blog post in Markdown. 
    - Files end in .html.md 
    - Follow examples under [/source/posts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/source/posts)
    - Follow the [style guide] and make sure to spell-check your work before
    submitting.
3. Create a MR to prompt a review
    - Make the MR in WIP mode. Meaning add WIP: to the title so it won't be merged accidentally. 
    - cc @nearlythere to prompt a review.
    - Add @nearlythere and @axil as developers on your project so they can make changes directly.
4. Review
    - You will get a formal/style review. Does it follow the [style guide]? Is it easy to follow?
    - You will get a technical review. A technical review will ensure everything works as expected and follows our best practices.
    - You'll get a "eagle eyes" copy edit for any final issues with grammar.
5. Finally we'll schedule and we'll publish!

(If these steps aren't clear, you can also create a 
first draft in Google Docs, and submit for review.)
